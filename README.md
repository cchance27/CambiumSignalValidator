# cnMaestro Reporting
Validation of actual Cambium SM Signals vs Expectations to detect misalignments.

Utilizing a connection to cnMaestro and direct SNMP communication with SM and APs to 
recieve additional information, we will run comparisons based of Free Path Space Loss to 
calculate how far off the various radios are from where they should be.

This will present a solid report for targeted visits to repair problems before clients can complain.

Additional Outputs such as KMZ for mapping of towers/panels/subscribers are also planned.

To compile and run appsettings.example.json must be renamed and configured as appsettings.json
